SoftMoon WebWare’s MasterColorPicker package delivers five JavaScript™ powered professional quality interactive graphical color-pickers, plus a named-color-table based color-picker framework with seven named-color database files included: Brewer, common, Crayola, HTML, OpenOffice, universal, & X11.  Your chosen colors can be returned in the most popular color-space models including hexadecimal-RGB, RGB, HSL, HSB, HCG, or CMYK, or when using named-colors their names can also be returned.  The different graphical color-pickers each look at the different available color-spaces in a different way, giving you complete intuitive control over finding the exact color you want.  Best of all, you can work with one color-space graphically, while outputting the corresponding conversion value from another color-space.  The five interactive graphical color-pickers included are:

RainbowMaestro Harmonic Color Picker™
    Specializes in color-harmony, shows light/dark shades (monochromatic) of a selected hue and its complement, triadic complements, split-complements, and analogous colors, all in one color-wheel. Includes a “websafe colors” setting;  Colorblind assistant shows protan, deutan, & tritan simulations of the palette and selected color.
Spectral Progressive Color Picker™
    Shows the progression of colors in steps based on the RGB color-space.  Works with browsers as far back as Internet Exploder 6.
BeezEye Color Picker™
    Classic color-wheel shows HSL, HSB, HCG, and CMYK color-spaces (one at a time) with user-controlled Lightness/Brightness/Gray/Black.
Simple² Color Picker™
    Works with the HSL and HSB color-spaces (both at once) to bring you simple access to the shades of any color from the “pure” color to →black, →white, and →gray.
YinYang NíHóng Color Picker™
    Another classic style, delivers all of the 11,777,216 colors your 24-bit monitor can show within two easy clicks using either the HSL, HSB or HCG color-spaces.

All these graphical color pickers, except for the YinYang NíHóng color picker, are designed to show colors in definite “steps” of progression, allowing you to easily work with gradients (see our Rainbow-Maker projects) and find “matching” colors from other hues/shades.  The number of steps, or variety of colors, is user-controllable in real-time, from just a few to “high resolution”.
