<section id='content' class='content'>
<p>SoftMoon WebWare’s MasterColorPicker package delivers five JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> powered professional quality
interactive graphical color-pickers, plus a named-color-table based color-picker framework with seven
named-color database files included: Brewer, common, Crayola, <acronym>HTML</acronym>, OpenOffice, universal, &amp; X11.&nbsp;
Your chosen colors can be returned in the most popular color-space models including hexadecimal-<acronym>RGB</acronym>,
<acronym title='red, green, blue'>RGB</acronym>,
<acronym title='hue, saturation, lightness'>HSL</acronym>,
<acronym title='hue, saturation, brightness; also known as HSV: hue, saturation, value'>HSB</acronym>,
<acronym title='hue, chroma, gray'>HCG</acronym>, or
<acronym title='cyan, magenta, yellow, black;  used when printing with inks'>CMYK</acronym>,
or when using named-colors their names can also be returned.&nbsp;
The different graphical color-pickers each look at the different available color-spaces in a different way,
giving you complete intuitive control over finding the exact color you want.&nbsp;
Best of all, you can work with one color-space graphically,
while outputting the corresponding conversion value from another color-space.&nbsp;
The five interactive graphical color-pickers included are:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>RainbowMaestro Harmonic Color Picker<mark class='macronym'>™</mark></dt>
		<dd>Specializes in color-harmony, shows light/dark shades (monochromatic) of a selected hue and its complement,
				triadic complements, split-complements, and analogous colors, all in one color-wheel.
				Includes a “websafe colors” setting;&nbsp;
				Colorblind assistant shows protan, deutan, &amp; tritan simulations of the palette and selected color.</dd>
	<dt>Spectral Progressive Color Picker<mark class='macronym'>™</mark></dt>
		<dd>Shows the progression of colors in steps based on the <acronym>RGB</acronym> color-space.&nbsp;
				Works with browsers as far back as Internet Exploder 6.</dd>
	<dt>BeezEye Color Picker<mark class='macronym'>™</mark></dt>
		<dd>Classic color-wheel shows <acronym>HSL</acronym>, <acronym>HSB</acronym>, <acronym>HCG</acronym>,
				and <acronym>CMYK</acronym> color-spaces (one at a time) with user-controlled Lightness/Brightness/Gray/Black.</dd>
	<dt>Simple² Color Picker<mark class='macronym'>™</mark></dt>
		<dd>Works with the <acronym>HSL</acronym> and <acronym>HSB</acronym> color-spaces (both at once) to bring you
				simple access to the shades of any color from the color to →black, →white, and →gray.</dd>
	<dt>YinYang NíHóng Color Picker<mark class='macronym'>™</mark></dt>
		<dd>Another classic style, delivers all of the 11,777,216 colors your 24-bit monitor can show within two easy clicks
				using either the <acronym>HSL</acronym>, <acronym>HSB</acronym> or <acronym>HCG</acronym> color-spaces.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All these graphical color pickers, except for the YinYang NíHóng color picker, are designed to
show colors in definite “steps” of progression, allowing you to easily work with gradients (see our Rainbow-Maker projects)
and find “matching” colors from other hues/shades.&nbsp; The number of steps, or variety of colors,
is user-controllable in real-time, from just a few to “high resolution”.</p>

<p>¡As of <del>late October 2014</del> August 2015, I have pre-released MasterColorPicker version 2.0.01-alpha.&nbsp;
This version now will <del>almost</del> completely work with newer versions of Firefox (39+) (see below),
and also gives the user the ability to drag &amp; drop the “picker panels”
around the window and/or <acronym>HTML</acronym> page the MasterColorPicker is embedded in
(<abbr title='also known as'>a.k.a.</abbr> “sticky panels” because the user can “stick” them back-and-forth to either
the window (<code>position: fixed</code>) or page (<code>position: absolute</code>) in real-time).&nbsp;
In addition, several new auxiliary panels are included in the <acronym>HTML</acronym> front-end
showing off the features that will be included when
version 2.0-beta is complete and ready to be released.&nbsp;
Only the “color-filter,” “color-space lab,” and “myPalette” features have any integrated working functionality (and “myPalette” is still incomplete),
but this release shows off the latest update to the <code>Picker</code> class which is the
supporting framework for the MasterColorPicker project.&nbsp;
The MasterColorPicker code-set remains largely unchanged at the low-level, however, at a higher level,
the <code>x-ColorPicker</code> class is no longer a simple static-functional class, rather it now
constructs “color picker” objects; this will be necessary to integrate the planned enhancements.&nbsp;
One minor annoyance bug was fixed with the “RainbowMaestro” picker: when you manually type in the
focal-hue degree and press <kbd><span>Enter</span></kbd> and then click on a color it is now recognized,
whereas before this click needlessly updated the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> as focus was taken from the
focal-hue input, so the <code>onClick</code> event never could occur since the old <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
was discarded before the event could trigger.&nbsp;
For now, if you want to use the <code>MasterColorPicker.php</code> file,
you will want to manually remove the new panels and hide their supporting options in the “options panel”
if you include this update in your own project — see the<acronym>HTML</acronym> comments in the file.&nbsp;
The <code>MasterColorPicker_desktop.htm</code> file already has this done.&nbsp;
Also note this update requires updated <code>UniDOM.js</code> and <code>Picker.js</code> files,
and in particular, <code>UniDOM</code> has been completed, updated, and bug-fixed, and is now
a very useful &amp; powerful project in its own right, not merely an included support file of some common functions.&nbsp;
I’m still not sure when I will find time to finish MasterColorPicker 2.0-beta, (but hopefully soon)
so I’m releasing 2.0-alpha just to keep up with the current browser changes, minimal bug-fixes and enhancements.&nbsp;
Note this latest August 2015 release also requires 3 additional files:
<code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/SoftMoon-WebWare/FormFieldGenie.js</code>,
<code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/Math+++.js</code> &amp;
<code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/Stylesheet.js</code>.</p>

<p>Now these ain’t your grandpa’s color pickers, mind you.&nbsp;
The MasterColorPicker project is of a cutting-edge design
that relies on a modern computer that can process the JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> fast enough,
and a modern browser with <acronym>HTML5</acronym> <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag support and
<a href='http://caniuse.com/#feat=forms' target='aux_page'><acronym>HTML5</acronym> forms support</a>
for the slider controls to work (sliders are the only real way for this to work well for users in real time).&nbsp;
At the time of the first MasterColorPicker release, only
Google’s<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>,
Apple’s<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Safari<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>,
the Opera<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> browser,
and Microsoft’s<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Internet Exploder 10 had this capability natively.&nbsp;
With earlier versions of Mozilla’s<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>, you were completely lost;&nbsp;
most of the problem resided with bugs in Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>, but there was also a bug in the supporting UniDOM file
(it was rushed out and not fully developed or debugged).
At this time of writing (Oct 2014) Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> version 33 is out, and although it won’t function at all on my computer
(I get a blank black screen, with nothing in the title-bar or menu-bar of the Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> window),
version 32 (and maybe some earlier) supports input sliders and displays the table <acronym>HTML</acronym> correctly,
and with the latest (complete &amp; debugged) version of UniDOM, you can pick colors in most of the pickers;&nbsp;
however, ealier Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> still has problems delivering the correct <code>{x,y}</code> position of the mouse on the screen
when it is over a “bounding box” of a <code>transform: rotate</code>d Element and therefore
the “BeezEye” &amp; “Simple²” pickers still don’t work correctly (note the “bounding box” is larger
than the displayed rotated Element, and is based on the displayed position as well as “untransformed” position).&nbsp;
<del>I’m hoping the folks at Mozilla<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> get their act together soon, and get a fully working browser up and out,
but in the meantime, you might restyle these two pickers and/or completely rewrite their <acronym>HTML</acronym> to get them to work.</del>&nbsp;
Now (Aug 2015) that Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> 39 is out (I had to hover-over or right-click and choose “properties” on the
<code class='filename'>firefox.exe</code> file in the “programs” folder to find the version number!) the only bug I find
is that the <code>event.detail</code> property =1 during <code>mousemove</code> events following a <code>click</code>
event when the specs on the Mozilla<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Developers Page says it should be =0.&nbsp;
This did cause a bug, but I overcame it, and now Firefox<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> seems to be in the lead for full support of MasterColorPicker,
excepting some minor <acronym title='cascading style sheet'>CSS</acronym> layout discrepencies
(I’ll worry about them in the final stages of development if Mozilla<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> hasn’t fixed them first).&nbsp;
Opera<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> 12.16 (out when MasterColorPicker first was released), and  as usual has no known bugs
(that couldn’t be overcome with a bit more <acronym>CSS</acronym>),
applied styling looks the most elegant overall,
and has the best overall performance tied with older Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>,
in terms of speed of page load &amp; color-picker rendering being acceptably fast with an average modern computer.&nbsp;
(Just don’t trust it to keep your bookmarks if you update,
so turn <strong>off</strong> auto-update and backup, backup, backup!
With the last update happening automatically and again clearing out my bookmarks, I removed Opera from my computer…F them!)&nbsp;
Old versions of Google’s<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> get you there, but it’s still a bit
quirky; don’t try to scroll the main page while the color-picker is displayed in a fixed position!&nbsp;
For that reason, you may want to use JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> to feed
old Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> the same <acronym>CSS</acronym> patch file that
<acronym title='Microsoft’s Internet Exploder 9'>MSIE9</acronym> uses — or better, simply demand that your users update.&nbsp;
And old Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> insists that rotated <code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code> tags
be rendered with a white background, even with inline styles set; not a “problem” just less elegant looking.&nbsp;
With the new Opera<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> (currently version 25) and
Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> (currently version 38) (Oct 2014) now joining forces
to use the new “Blink” browser foundation, both browsers display the default <acronym>HTML</acronym> correctly
and work correctly, however, Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> is now the fastest of all browsers.&nbsp;
August 2015 note: I ditched Opera<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> since they deleted all my bookmarks, so no comment there, but
Chrome<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> works except for it does not update the
<acronym title='cascading style sheet'>CSS</acronym> <code>:hover</code> conditions as the mouse moves over the page
with the button held down when dragging colors in the “myPalette” panel.&nbsp;

With Safari<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> on an Apple<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Mac<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>
(untested using Safari<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> on Windows<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>)
(also untested on any newer (2014) versions — I don’t (won’t) have an Apple)
<code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code> tags
are rendered only in solid black with a transparent background.&nbsp;
(¡¡New 2014 note: I finally found instructions on how to style a range-bar in <acronym>CSS</acronym>!!&nbsp;
But as noted, I don’t have an Apple to test this.&nbsp;
By the time I release MasterColorPicker 2.0 beta, I should have this problem worked out for sure.)&nbsp;
The black-on-black rendered by Safari<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> is then invisible.&nbsp;
I chose black as the background for the color-pickers because it shows the colors better,
and provides a stark contrast with most web-pages, giving the “pop-up” more of a “panel” feel.&nbsp;
Solutions include wrapping every <code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code> tag with a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
and then styling the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with a background; forcing Safari<mark class='macronym'>®</mark>
to use the FD-slider package that <acronym>MSIE9</acronym>
needs (see below); or using JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> to feed in another stylesheet
to alter the color-styling of the “<code>mainPanel</code>”.&nbsp;
I don’t care for superfluous <acronym>HTML</acronym> tags added simply for visual styling — that goes against the
principle of separation of content from styling.&nbsp;
But Safari leaves little choice, as a background other that black simply does not seem to work well in the overall picture.&nbsp;
My solution is to use JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> targeted only for Safari<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> to
add in all those superfluous <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags wrapped around each <code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code>
on the <code>mainPanel</code> (fix in version 1.0.4).&nbsp;
With Microsoft’s<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> Internet Exploder 9,
even though color-picker rendering is slower than molasses in winter when adjusting values,
you might be able to use a JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> package like the one from
Brian McAllister of frequency-decoder (the FD-slider)
to add the needed <code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code> capabilities; but note that package only works under some
conditions on some browsers.&nbsp;
I <a href='http://softmoon-webware.com/FD-slider_SM-enhanced_instructions.htm'>enhanced it</a> to work better
with more complicated layouts, and also added the ability to work with rotated sliders,
and included its basics with the MasterColorPicker files.&nbsp;
Never-the-less, it does <em>not</em> work with the basic supplied server-based <acronym>CSS</acronym> file which
places the pickers in a fixed-position format in the top-right of the browser window,
but there is a supplied patch-file, that works with <em>some</em> overall page structures
(where you place the MasterColorPicker in the document, and what the parent element is,
and what else it contains, and how you style that parent and the rest of the document),
which you can target to <acronym>MSIE9</acronym>.&nbsp;
(see the simple fix which you should target to that browser in the section on
<a href='#using_MasterColorPicker'>using the MasterColorPicker</a> below).&nbsp;
But these color-pickers are completely flexible and don’t rely on any specific <acronym>CSS</acronym> styling.&nbsp;
In fact, except for the Spectral Progressive color-picker and the named-color tables,
the <acronym>HTML</acronym> is flexible too: use whatever tags you want/need, with only minimal restriction
on placing tag <abbr title='identification attributes'>id</abbr>s on appropriate wrapper elements.&nbsp;
With all that said, there is even a hack that skips the <code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code> for browsers with at
least <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> support, but it’s more of an unfriendly work-around for both users and programmers…
See below for technical details on the <acronym>HTML</acronym>
<a href='#picker_requirements'>requirements</a> for each individual color-picker,
and the section on <a href='#registering_interfaces'>registering interface elements</a>.&nbsp;
Finally, if you must have support for older browsers, maybe either the
<a href='http://raphaeljs.com/'>Raphaël—JavaScript Library</a>
(the way I would go as <acronym>SVG</acronym> is even more powerful and universal) or
<a href='http://flashcanvas.net/'>http://flashcanvas.net/</a>
(I would avoid as Flash<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> is on its way out!)
can help: but you will at least need to modify <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.js</code>,
a bit more than I have time for right now as I’m looking forward not backward <big>☺</big></p>

<h3 id='desktop-server'>Desktop <abbr title='versus'>vs.</abbr> Server</h3>

<p>The package includes two versions: desktop and server-based.&nbsp;
The desktop version can be placed in a folder on your personal computer and used to find the colors of your dream’s desire.&nbsp;
But while the desktop version can also be incorporated into your own web page and served from your server, you guessed it,
the server-based version requires a server such as Apache for example
(you can always put a server on your home machine, of course, and use the server version on your desktop).&nbsp;
But the server-based version is much more convenient to use if you plan on adding or deleting
named-color database tables on a regular basis.&nbsp;
For instance, you might use the server-based package to allow customers to choose the color they want based on
the product they are interested in, one table for each product line, and your product line may be dynamic.&nbsp;
With the server-based version, you simply create the named-color database file and add it to the proper folder; that’s it.&nbsp;
Remove it from the folder when you are done with it.&nbsp;
With the desktop version, you must manually add and remove links to each of the named-color tables,
whether served with your web-pages, or simply using the desktop tool.</p>

<p>There is another factor in deciding whether to use the desktop or server version when incorporating the
MasterColorPicker into your own website.&nbsp; The named-colors database files are <acronym>JSON</acronym> formatted.&nbsp;
With the server based version, these files are loaded using JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark>
to make HTTP calls back to the server (think ajax), whereas with the desktop version,
they are themselves JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> files loaded with an <acronym>HTML</acronym>
<code>&lt;script src='colors-filename.js'&gt;</code> tag.&nbsp;
This means that the server version can interpret the files,
whereas in the desktop version the database files are required to be legal JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark>.&nbsp;
And this means that the server version has database files that can be used easier with server-side languages,
such as <acronym>PHP</acronym>.&nbsp;
<acronym>PHP</acronym> has a function, <code>json_decode()</code> that quickly and simply converts
<acronym>JSON</acronym>-encoded text-strings.&nbsp; But the desktop version requires that the
<acronym>JSON</acronym> Object is <em>assigned</em> to something right there in the database file itself, and
<acronym>PHP</acronym> can not natively read this.&nbsp; Of course, with a little ingenuity, you could strip off
the “assignment” within the JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark>-based-database file and then parse it
natively using <acronym>PHP</acronym>;
more overhead on overworked servers is never a good thing, though, however small.</p>

<h3 id='named-colors'>Named-color tables</h3>

<p>Because the named-color database tables are required to be in only slightly different formats,
and many of the files are very long, these database files only come packaged in one format: for the desktop version.&nbsp;
There is an included <acronym>PHP</acronym> powered converter which will convert all the files to the server version format.&nbsp;
There is also an instruction file which explains the details on how to do this using the included converter,
and also how to do this by hand.&nbsp;
These two files, <code class='filename'>convert_palette_formats.php</code> and <code class='filename'>converting_palette_formats.rtf</code>,&nbsp;
can be found in the <code class='filename'>color_palettes</code> folder.</p>

<p>Building your own named-color-tables is simple to do using any basic text-editor.&nbsp;
Complete instructions on how to do this can be found in the <code class='filename'>README.rtf</code> file
in the <code class='filename'>color_palettes</code> folder.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id='using_MasterColorPicker'>Using MasterColorPicker in your own project</h3>

<p>It’s very easy to incorporate the MasterColorPicker (or even any of its individual pickers) into your own project.&nbsp;
To limit download size, but maximize ease of use, two different but similar files are included.&nbsp;
The desktop version is built with pure <acronym>HTML</acronym> (file name <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker_desktop.htm</code>),
while the server version is built with embedded <acronym>PHP</acronym> (file name <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.php</code>).&nbsp;
The desktop file is a complete <acronym>HTML</acronym> page with a head and body, while the server version only contains
the needed <acronym>HTML</acronym> for the MasterColorPicker project itself.&nbsp;
The <acronym>PHP</acronym> generated <acronym>HTML</acronym> is essentially the same as the pure <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
except the <acronym>PHP</acronym> can keep track of the settings on the individual pickers, and keep them set the
way the user sets them, in between page invocations.&nbsp;
Doing this requires that the color-pickers <acronym>HTML</acronym> be either enclosed within a <code>&lt;form method='post'&gt;</code>
tag, or otherwise “attached” to a form, and submitted back to the server.&nbsp;
Generally, if you are picking a color, you will be sending form data anyway.&nbsp;
But you do not need to use the <acronym>PHP</acronym> file with the rest of the server version.&nbsp;
(What defines the server-version is the way named-color tables are used:
see <a href='#desktop-server'>Desktop <abbr title='versus'>vs.</abbr> Server</a>).
Simply “cut out” the proper section of <acronym>HTML</acronym> from the desktop version file
(the file is commented so you can tell what to cut), and either make it a new file: <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.htm</code>
or simply paste it into your own web-page file; either way you then incorporate the MaterColorPicker <acronym>HTML</acronym>
at whatever place in your document you desire.&nbsp;
To use the <acronym>PHP</acronym> file with your <acronym>PHP</acronym> webpage, simply place
<code>&lt;?php include "color-pickers/SoftMoon-WebWare/MasterColorPicker.php"; ?&gt;</code> in your document at the
appropriate place.&nbsp;
Or you can use your own <acronym>HTML</acronym>, with no restriction on the tags used, and minimal requirements on the
structure: just place a few <abbr title='identification attributes'>id</abbr>s on appropriate wrapper elements.&nbsp;
You can use and/or modify the supplied <acronym>CSS</acronym> files, or write your own
(see <a href='#your_structure'>customizing MasterColorPicker</a> below).
</p>

<p>Link the main <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.css</code> file in the head of your document if you plan on using it.&nbsp;
If you want to use this file with Internet Exploder 9, you will need conditional comments to load in the
<code class='filename'>fd-slider_SM-enhanced.js</code> file and its stylesheet.&nbsp;
At this point you should simply also be able to
link the <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker_MSIE9-patch.css</code> file; however, this is Microsoft.&nbsp;
They give you a lame hack requiring conditional comments to overcome their lack of commitment to
working <acronym>CSS</acronym>, and then that hack they specifically recommend doesn’t work half the time.&nbsp;
<acronym>CSS</acronym> means “<em>cascading</em> style sheets”, yet Microsoft developers don’t know how to apply a
simple cascade, even in <acronym>IE9</acronym>, 15 years after the concept was introduced.&nbsp;
Open the <kbd><span>F12</span></kbd> developers tools, and it <em>shows</em> as all being there………&nbsp;
If you don’t place the MasterColorPicker <acronym>HTML</acronym> within the “right” overall page structure
(don’t ask for a definitive answer on what that means or entails!…this is Microsoft!),
or even if you simply add a <code>title</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag
(a basic standard <acronym>DOM</acronym> attribute
which is supposed to give you an easy &amp; definitive interface handle within JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark>
to each individual stylesheet, or your code must otherwise “know” the stylesheets’ file names or which order they are linked,
which means hard-coding the answer – bad practice!)
rules may simply be ignored in the patch file.&nbsp;
<strong>So</strong>, if you find that to be the case, you must manually copy and paste the text of the patch file in to
<code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags embedded in the head of the document.&nbsp; Low and behold!&nbsp; They now apply!</p>

<code style='width: 47em;'>&#60;!--[if lt IE 10]&#62;

&#60;/style&#62;
&#60;![endif]--&#62;</code>

<p>You should also fix the way <acronym>MSIE</acronym> handles
table captions and fieldset legends in general as shown above.&nbsp;
For MSIE10, (¡oh no! another nightmare browser for developers!&nbsp; And they were doing so good with MSIE9…
And Windows<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> 8 takes the cake for user-<strong><em>un</em></strong>friendliness)
you need to take in account that the browser-window’s scrollbar may randomly appear on the right side of the screen,
covering the browser-window’s content,
whenever Windows<mark class='macronym'>®</mark> decides the user wants to scroll
(why the user can’t decide this I don’t know, other than the folks at Microsoft are just so arrogant as to think
that <em><strong>they</strong></em> should be in control of your computer,
and you are just a data-mine of personal info and usage statistics).&nbsp;
Without a margin, any scrollbar for the “mainPanel” can be covered by a “ghost” scrollbar for the whole window,
leaving the user unable to control what it is they are trying to scroll.&nbsp;
And of last note, again <acronym>MSIE</acronym> fails to apply cascades correctly, and fails to handle
<acronym>CSS</acronym> <code>:hover</code> directives correctly,
when you try to use the color-space output <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>.&nbsp;
The attempted hack to fix this at least preserves the pull-down menu!&nbsp;
But the rest of the options panel, including the main body of the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> disappears
when you hover the mouse over this pull-down!&nbsp;
So sad that leaders of the Human Race do so with make-up and mirrors,
not true leadership or intelligence or even by attempting basic working solutions.&nbsp;
But as the Tao says, nothing lasts…
Anyway, depending on your overall page layout,
you may want to reposition the options panel and/or keep it visible when the MasterColorPicker is active
by modifying the supplied main <acronym>CSS</acronym> file instead of cascading with additional styles.</p>

<p>Your <acronym>HTML</acronym> (web page) file <strong>must</strong> be encoded in <acronym>UTF-8</acronym>.&nbsp;
You should already be using this encoding in all your web page files anyway.&nbsp;
JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> is required to be encoded in <acronym>UTF-8</acronym>,
and this project uses a character set beyond the standard <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.&nbsp;
Remember, <acronym>UTF-8</acronym> is <em>the</em> #1 international choice for character encoding;&nbsp;
it even helps protect your site against
<a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/metatags/qt/meta-charset.htm">cross-site scripting</a>
(<abbr title='versus'>vs.</abbr> the default <acronym>UTF-7</acronym>).</p>

<h3 id='using_picker'>Using the Picker interface</h3>
<p>MasterColorPicker is built on an instance of SoftMoon-WebWare’s Picker interface,
which creates a new input “type:” picker.&nbsp;
Using this interface is easy.&nbsp;
The most simple way to use this project is to place anywhere within your document any number of
<code>&lt;input type='MasterColorPicker' /&gt;</code> tags and/or
<code>&lt;input type='text' pickerType='MasterColorPicker' /&gt;</code> tags.&nbsp;
The MasterColorPicker will find them when the document is fully loaded and automatically “register them,” i.e.
add the necessary event-handlers to interface with the Picker.&nbsp;
Using <code>&lt;input type='color' pickerType='MasterColorPicker' /&gt;</code> tags can work with the MasterColorPicker
also, and with browsers that already support this natively, you will get the native color-picker plus the MasterColorPicker;&nbsp;
but caution:&nbsp; the <acronym>W3C</acronym> specs say that <code>&lt;input type='color' /&gt;</code> should limit
the user’s input to basic ways of defining colors, which means that your MasterColorPicker implementation should limit
its output to hexadecimal <acronym>RGB</acronym> with a leading <code>#</code> symbol.</p>

<p>If you don’t like non-standard tag attributes, or you otherwise want to link an input tag to the MasterColorPicker,
after the <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.js</code> file is loaded, you can use JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> to
link the input tag something like this:
</p>
<code>&#60;script type='text/javascript'&#62;
myInput=document.getElementById('myMasterColorPickerInput')&#59;
MasterColorPicker.registerTargetElement(myInput)&#59;
&#60;/script&#62;</code>

<p>A registered target element activates the Picker when the user clicks on it, or it otherwise receives “focus”.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="using_swatch">Using the “color swatches”</h3>

<p>When a color is clicked on, the target element’s value is changed to the color-value-text.&nbsp;
Also, the associated “color swatch” has its background-color changed to the user-selected color,
while its foreground-color becomes either black or white, opposing the background-color’s brightness.&nbsp;
The “color swatch” is either the target element itself when <code>MasterColorPicker.showSwatchAs='background'</code>,
or when <code>MasterColorPicker.showSwatchAs='swatch'</code> the color swatch
is determined by the first valid condition in this list:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If the target is as such: <code>&lt;input swatchId='myDocumentId' /&gt;</code>
			then the swatch is a document element with an <abbr title='identification attribute'>id</abbr>
			that matches “myDocumentId” if it exists.</li>
	<li>If the target-object has a JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> property “swatch,”
			then the swatch is that property’s value.</li>
	<li>If the JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> Object property <code>MasterColorPicker.swatch</code> is set,
			then the swatch is that property’s value.</li>
	<li>The document Element that follows the target-input.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be sure to read the end of the file <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.js</code>
for more details on using the “color swatch”.</p>

<h3 id="your_target">Targets other than text <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s.</h3>

<p>You don’t need to use an <code>&lt;input type='text' /&gt;</code> with MasterColorPicker.&nbsp;
<code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;input type='text' list='datalistID' /&gt;</code>s,
and even document text-nodes are automatically recognized by the <code>MasterColorPicker.pick()</code> method.&nbsp;
By default, the JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> value of
<code>MasterColorPicker.dataTarget.value</code> is set when a color is picked.&nbsp;
If no <code>dataTarget</code> is set then the <code>MasterColorPicker.masterDataTarget</code> is used, if any.&nbsp;
The <code>dataTarget</code> and <code>masterDataTarget</code> each may be any
JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> Object.&nbsp;
Or they may be <code>&lt;input type='hidden'&gt;</code> if you don't care to show the user the dirty color-code,
but want to send the value back to the server with a form-submittal.&nbsp;
To supplement this functionality, add a JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> function to the
Array of <code>MasterColorPicker.pickFilters</code>.&nbsp;
To replace this functionality, replace the <code>MasterColorPicker.pick</code> method with your own function.&nbsp;
See the file <code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/SoftMoon-WebWare/Picker.js</code> for more details.</p>



<h3 id='your_structure'>Structuring your own <acronym>HTML</acronym> and <acronym>CSS</acronym></h3>

<p>The visual presentation of the individual color-pickers is up to you.&nbsp;
There are a few comments within the supplied <acronym>HTML</acronym>/<acronym>PHP</acronym> files
which will not be repeated here; you should read them.&nbsp;
One general consideration concerns the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag widths &amp; heights;&nbsp;
you may modify them, keeping in mind that the color-pickers build their palettes based on the given width
of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, so it is best to keep the width/height of the canvases equal
(excepting some of the canvases in the Simple² &amp; YinYang NíHóng pickers).&nbsp;
The important requirements to follow are listed below for each of the color-pickers in the MasterColorPicker project:

<p>When the user clicks on a registered target element or it otherwise receives “focus,”
the MasterColorPicker is activated.&nbsp;
When activated, the MasterColorPicker “main panel” and “options panel” (see the <acronym>HTML</acronym>),
as well as the currently selected color-picker,
all receive the classname “activePicker”.&nbsp;
There are other classnames added to various <acronym>HTML</acronym> elements in the MasterColorPicker under other various conditions.&nbsp;
For more detailed info on what classnames are applied and when, please see the comments in the
<code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/SoftMoon-WebWare/Picker.js</code> file.&nbsp;
To modify these used classnames, modify the values of the JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark>
properties of <code>MasterColorPicker.classnames</code>.&nbsp;
By understanding when and why these classnames are applied,
you can create your own <acronym>CSS</acronym> file to control the dynamic display of the MasterColorPicker.</p>

<h3 id='add_rmv_pckr'>Adding &amp; removing color-pickers</h3>

<p>You may add your own color-pickers to, or remove individual color-pickers from the MasterColorPicker framework.&nbsp;
To remove one or more of the included color-pickers, simply remove its <acronym>HTML</acronym>
and JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> from the given files.&nbsp;
The sections are clearly deliminated with comments.&nbsp;
The <code>x_ColorPicker</code> JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> Class is universal to
all color-pickers in the MasterColorPicker framework, and should remain.&nbsp;
Don’t forget to lighten the weight of the <acronym>CSS</acronym> file, but that is not a requirement.&nbsp;<p>

<p>Adding your own (or someone else’s) color-picker is easy.&nbsp;
Its <acronym>HTML</acronym> should be included within the <code>MasterColorPicker_mainPanel</code> (see the supplied files),
and its <abbr title='identification attribute'>id</abbr> should match the choice offered in the <code>palette_select</code>.&nbsp;
You should of course add this choice to the <code>palette_select</code>.&nbsp;
The <code>palette_select</code> choice may have spaces to match the “display name” of your added color-picker,
and these will be removed when matching an <abbr title='identification attribute'>id</abbr>;&nbsp;
for example a choice of “YinYang NíHóng” corresponds to <abbr title='identification attribute'>id</abbr> “YinYangNíHóng”.&nbsp;

<p>To interface another color-picker with the MasterColorPicker framework is easy,
but as powerful things go, this process has details that must be understood to fully utilize.&nbsp;
Most simply, when a color is selected, using JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark>,
simply call <code>MasterColorPicker.pick(<var>……colorChoiceText……</var>)</code>;&nbsp;
however this bypasses the central <code>x_ColorPicker</code> framework which can
convert the choice to the user’s color-space preferences,
and set the color of “color swatches”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the <code>x_ColorPicker</code> framework is a bit different, as it is “event” oriented.&nbsp;
Please read the comments in the <code>MasterColorPicker.js</code> file regarding the <code>x_ColorPicker</code> framework,
but here are some basic additional notes.&nbsp;
The <code>x_ColorPicker</code> framework offers
a <code>handleMouse</code> method for onmouseover, onmousemove, and onmouseout events,
and a <code>handleClick</code> method for onclick events.&nbsp;
They require two arguments passed in, yet browsers only pass in the first by default: the <code>event</code> object.&nbsp;
So you must either use your own event handler which calls these <code>x_ColorPicker</code> methods,
or, more conveniently, use the <code>UniDOM</code> framework that is included with this package to add these methods
as event handlers.&nbsp;
Take a close look (in the <code class='filename'>MasterColorPicker.js</code> file at the end of each color-picker’s section)
at how the supplied color-pickers add their event handlers using the
<code>UniDOM</code> framework, and how the <code>args</code> object is passed on to the <code>x_ColorPicker</code> methods
by adding it as a final argument passed to <code>UniDOM.addEventHandler(………)</code>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id='building pickers'>Building your own color-pickers</h3>

<p id='registering_interfaces'>SoftMoon-WebWare’s Picker Class framework
on which the MasterColorPicker is based is a powerful tool that creates
an <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> “type = picker”.&nbsp;
Your color-picker can be as complex as you need it to be, with multiple “interface panels,”
interactive inputs that modify the picker and/or its choices, etc.&nbsp;
Please carefully read the <code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/SoftMoon-WebWare/Picker.js</code> file and its comments
about “registering” these interface panels and interface elements.&nbsp;
Registering them adds the necessary event handlers for them to work correctly with the MasterColorPicker framework.&nbsp;
All <acronym>HTML</acronym> elements that require keyboard “focus”
(such as <code>&lt;input type='text|file|number|<var>etc.</var>' /&gt;</code> <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>)
that are part of your picker must be registered
using <code>MasterColorPicker.registerInterfaceElement(<var>……element……</var>)</code>.&nbsp;
Note how you can use this feature to replace the <code>&lt;input type='range' /&gt;</code> elements in the supplied files
with <code>&lt;input type='text' /&gt;</code> elements if you register them.&nbsp;
This will allow users to enter illegal or overwhelmingly large values, so to get this to work properly,
you should also add a plethora of JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> keyboard filters
to make sure that, say, the variety value on the RainbowMaestro isn’t set for 10,000 which would lock up the
display for a few minutes or so (multiply by 5 for <acronym title='Microsoft’s Internet Exploder'>MSIE</acronym>)
while the millions upon millions of calculations are done.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3 id='about_options'>The “options” panel</h3>

<p>The <acronym>HTML</acronym> options panel may offer your users more control of the returned color than you need them to have.&nbsp;
You may only want values returned as hexadecimal-<acronym>RGB</acronym>, or whatever.&nbsp;
The color-pickers included in the MasterColorPicker project all rely on
SoftMoon-WebWare’s JavaScript<mark class='macronym'>™</mark> <code>rgb</code> Class for all their
color-space conversion needs.&nbsp;
This class has several flags that you can set
(see the comments in the <code class='filename'>JS_toolbox/SoftMoon-WebWare/rgb.js</code> file),
and simply remove the options from the <acronym>HTML</acronym> options panel.&nbsp;
The <code>palette_mode</code> must remain in the <acronym>HTML</acronym> somewhere
(to work with the <code>x_ColorPicker</code> framework),
but it can be reduced to something like:
<code>&lt;input type='hidden' id='palette_mode' value='hex' /&gt;</code>.&nbsp;
If you do remove options from the options panel, you may remove some, most, or all of the file
<code class='filename'>color-pickers/SoftMoon-WebWare/color-space_autoReformatter.js</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>MasterColorPicker_optionsPanel</code> may be moved into the
<code>MasterColorPicker_mainPanel</code> (see the comments in the file) and if using the supplied <acronym>CSS</acronym> file,
it will pop-up and pop-down with the main panel, or if you know <acronym>CSS</acronym>,
it’s a simple modification to the <acronym>CSS</acronym> file to achieve the same result.&nbsp;</p>
